Installation
============

Just as ``Manim`` the ``Manim Editor`` is a `Python package on PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/manim-editor/>`__.
If you know what you're doing, simply install it using pip.
But make sure that FFmpeg is accessible through the ``ffmpeg`` command.

First you have to `install Manim <https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html#local-installation>`__ and ensure that it functions on your system.

.. tip::

    On Windows it is recommended to use the manual installation as it simplifies the installation of the ``Manim Editor`` later on.

Once your Python environment is functioning and populated with ``Manim`` and its requirements you can run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install manim-editor

Now the ``Manim Editor`` is accessible through the terminal via ``manim_editor`` or ``manedit``.

If you've gotten stuck and don't know what to do, feel free to ask on the `Manim Discord Server <https://www.manim.community/discord/>`__ or open an `Issue on GitHub <https://github.com/ManimEditorProject/manim_editor/issues>`__.
(The latter is preferred.)
