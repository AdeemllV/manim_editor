Presenter
=========

When you've created a project and you launch ``manedit``, you can select the project and edit it.
If everything is to your liking you can export the project as a presentation.
This adds a few files required to present the project to the project directory.
You can copy this directory to a flash drive or wherever you need it.
Now don't need the ``Manim Editor`` to be installed anymore to be able to present the project.
You only need a local web server.
If you have Python installed, you're good to go.
Simply run this in the projects directory:


.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m http.server


Instead of running a local web server you can host the project on an online web server (e.g. GitHub Pages).
That way you can access it from anywhere.
This is how the `example <https://manimeditorproject.github.io/manim_editor/Tutorial/index.html>`_ has been created.
