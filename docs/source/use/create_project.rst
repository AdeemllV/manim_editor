Create a new Project
====================

The ``Manim Editor`` searches the current working directory (CWD) for ``Manim`` scenes.
Therefore you should run the ``manedit`` command where your ``media`` folder has been created.

That command launches a local web server on an open port.
It presents an address which you can open in your browser.
Here you can select any ``Manim Editor`` Projects you have created.
These projects house everything needed to present a project, including a copy of each section video.
All the sections belonging to a project don't have to belong to the same scene.

When you create a new project, the Editor asks you to select the scenes you want to be included in the new project.
