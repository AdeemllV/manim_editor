Manim Editor Overview
=====================

The Manim Editor is a tool for post-processing animations generated using Manim.

    Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can be difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them accurately.
    ``Manim`` uses Python to generate animations programmatically, making it possible to specify exactly how each one should run.

    -- The `Manim Documentation <https://docs.manim.community/en/stable>`_

The Manim Editor offers two main functions:
- Reliable presentation of technical concepts.
- Automated video editing (not yet implemented).

If you don't know how to use Manim, `it's documentation <https://docs.manim.community/en/stable>`_ is where you should start.
Come back once you've familiarised yourself with the core concepts.

.. tip::

    If you want to test the Manim Editor without having to install anything, take a look at the `example <https://manimeditorproject.github.io/manim_editor/tutorial/>`_
