Getting Started
===============

* First you have to `create the Manim scene <use/create_secen>`__.
  As `already described <use/index>`__ the ``Manim Editor`` uses projects, which are stored in one directory each.
* Once you have created your scenes, you can `create a Manim Editor project <use/create_project>`__.
* Finally you can `export that project as a presentation <use/export_presentation>`__.
* Or you could use `the CLI <use/cli>`__ if you don't want to use a web browser.
