Getting Started
===============

* First you have to `create the Manim scene <create_secen>`__.
  As `already described <index>`__ the ``Manim Editor`` uses projects, which are stored in one directory each.
* Once you have created your scenes, you can `create a Manim Editor project <create_project>`__.
* Finally you can `export that project as a presentation <export_presentation>`__.
