Getting Started
===============

* First you have to :ref:`create the Manim scene <create_scene>`.
  As :ref:`already described <index>` the ``Manim Editor`` uses projects, which are stored in one directory each.
* Once you have created your scenes, you can :ref:`create a Manim Editor project <create_project>`.
* Finally you can :ref:`export that project as a presentation <export_presentation>`.
* Or you could use :ref:`the CLI <cli>` if you don't want to use a web browser.
